## Date and Time

It is possible to change the `Timezone` of your business here. This is the timezone where your business operates. All the business hours, reception hours, and calendars across the app using this particular timezone.

💡 For example, if your business uses Asia/Tokyo timezone and you create a booking in the calendar in the Dashboard section, the booking is created under the same timezone regardless of the timezone where you are currently based.

The second settings option in this section is the `Time format`, select which one you prefer and it should be reflected across the app. We have two options, either 12 or 24-hour format.

## Notifications

This field is giving consent to the Sakurabook team to deliver you email updates about the app, other notifications, and marketing materials. We highly recommend having this checkbox checked.

## Integrations

This section is managing your connections or disconnection to the Google calendar and Zoom.

`Google calendar` takes care of synchronizing bookings with your company calendar. It is a one-way synchronization. Every booking which is created in Sakurabook is synchronized into your Google calendar. It does not currently work the other way around. Every rental space or staff has its own Google calendar created together with the first booking. You can subscribe to these calendars on the Google platform. Also, after connecting to Google calendar, your customers will receive email invitations to events created for each particular booking. See [Connect Google Calendar](./connect-google-calendar.md) guide.

`Zoom` connection serves for online services. After you connect to your company Zoom account, you can start using Online locations for your staff and services. This works only for the **Service reservation** use case. If you do not connect to Zoom, you cannot offer online locations. See [Connect Zoom](./connect-zoom.md) guide.
