# Import Product

In this document, we'll have a look into adding more products to the Sakurabook app. Before we can do that, make sure that you have created more products in the Shopify Admin Product section (https://your-store-name.myshopify.com/admin/products).

Moreover, add the appropriate tags (`Rental`, `Service`, `AddOn`) to your products so they will appear in the Sakurabook import window.

ðŸ“Œ Do you struggle with adding a product or tag? Go back to [Sakurabook Admin Setup](./setting-up-the-app-in-shopify.md#sakurabook-admin-setup) for details.

1. Navigate to `Services` or `Rental spaces` from the top main navigation bar. It depends on the use case you selected at the beginning. In the following steps, we show everything for **Service reservation** but the flow is the same for **Rental space reservation**.

2. Click on the `Add service` button (or `Add rental space` for the other case). You should now see the newly created product from the Shopify Admin Product section. Sakurabook shows you here all products with correct tags which are not already imported.
