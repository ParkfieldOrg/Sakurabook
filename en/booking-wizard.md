## Service reservation

1. After you get to the service product page in the Shopify store, you will see the Sakurabook Booking wizard on the right side. Since it is a **Service reservation** use case, the very first step is to select staff. You should see a profile photo, name, and some bio for each of the staff. You can use the arrows on the right for switching between staff or simply clicking on the profile photos. Click on the `Next` button when the staff is selected.

2. After you selected your staff, the next step is to select the date and location. Select the specific day, the first click is for the start day and the second click is for the end day. Click on the same day if it is for a short-term reservation like a couple of hours. Then select the location using the location dropdown. You can also see the detailed price information below.

## Booking states

There are overall three possible states for each booking. It differs according to the step in which the customer ended the process above.

ðŸ“Œ **TODO** fill in the XY values.

The `PENDING` state of the booking happens when customers leave the booking in their cart. They do not confirm the reservation. This is a state where we block the reserved day/time for XY hours.

The `CONFIRMED` state of the booking happens when customers confirm the order but do not pay yet. This is a state where we block the reserved day/time for XY days.

The `PAID` state happens when the booking is successfully paid. Here we block the booked day/time ultimately until the merchant makes some changes, e.g. after the customer's communication with the support team.
