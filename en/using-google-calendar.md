# Using Google Calendar

After you successfully [Connect Google Calendar](./connect-google-calendar.md) integration, you are eligible to start using Google Calendar functionality with Sakurabook. This guide walks you through the flow and what you can expect.

üìå We have also prepared two videos guides for you, feel free to watch them on our Youtube [Sakurabook channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCzs8kviSrLufN3ipRIeGc3Q/videos).

There are actually two ways of creating a booking and finding it inside your Google Calendar. The first one is to create a booking manually from the dashboard, see [Manage Bookings](./manage-bookings.md) guide. The other option is using the Shopify store and Sakurabook Booking Wizard, see the [Booking Wizard](./booking-wizard.md) guide.

5. Your customer will receive an invoice email from Shopify to complete the purchase. The customer then needs to pay for the order in several easy steps. This flow can be customized for several shops. Below are the usual steps.

   - Click on the `Complete your purchase` button in the email.
   - Fill in your details, then go to the next page.
   - Fill in the payment details, use [Bogus Gateway](https://help.shopify.com/en/manual/checkout-settings/test-orders) for test orders. Then pay for the order by clicking the `Pay now` button.
   - See the confirmation page.

6. After the booking is paid, your customer receives an order confirmation email from Shopify with information that the booking was successfully paid.

7. At the same time, there is one more email delivered directly from the Sakurabook app that confirms the reservation.

8. The last step is to check the [Google Calendar](https://calendar.google.com/) you connected to Sakurabook app. If it is the first booking of your staff or space, you should see newly created calendar in the left side menu. Each staff or space has it's own calendar. These calendars are synced with Sakurabook dashboard.

   üìå We do not currently reflect the Google calendar changes on our side. It's planned for future development.
