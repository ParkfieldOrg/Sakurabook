# Getting Started

Sakurabook is a plugin for pay-as-you-go reservation service which can be used within the Shopify ecosystem. So, if you are a Shopify merchant and you want to boost your online store with the Sakurabook reservation app, you are in the right place.

## Components

The app has two major parts:

- **Sakurabook Admin** - This is an embedded Shopify app in the admin console of your shop, e.g. https://your-store-name.myshopify.com/admin. This part is a merchant-facing user interface.

- **Sakurabook Booking Wizard** - On the other hand, this is the customer-facing app block that can be added directly to your store via the Shopify Theme customization. It's then accessible on your store, e.g. https://your-store-name.myshopify.com. Once you add it, the booking wizard lets your customers create reservations.

Once you've got a good understanding of Shopify and how the apps work, we can have a look at the two main use cases that Sakurabook offers:

## Business cases

- **Rental space reservation** - This is suitable for any kind of rental, e.g. hotels, short-term lettings, or other types of space reservations. Select this use case when customers do not need to choose a staff of yours.
- **Service reservation** - Choose the service type if there are specific staff/people to book. Suitable for yoga studios, therapists, hairdressing saloons, and other service providers.

Now, I believe you already know which use case is suitable for your online store. Let's have a look at how to set up the Sakurabook app in Shopify.
