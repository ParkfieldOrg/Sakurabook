## Deactivation

1. Go to the Services section where you can find all your created services. Select the `Active` section in the list.

2. Select the services you want to deactivate and click the `Deactivate` button which is right next to the select all button.

   📌 Keep in mind that if you deactivate the service in Sakurabook, it won't disappear from your store, you need to change the Product itself inside Shopify Admin as well. Make the product a draft and it'll disappear from your store.
