## Staff Videoconferencing

In the [Create Staff](./create-staff.md#videoconferencing) guide, we describe that you need to have the Zoom connection ready in order to offer online Zoom conferencing to your customers. Here you can see what it looks like when Zoom is correctly connected and when it isn't.

## Online Zoom Booking

There are two ways of creating an online Zoom booking. The first one is to create a booking manually from the dashboard, see [Manage Bookings](./manage-bookings.md) guide. The other option is using the Shopify store and Sakurabook Booking Wizard, see the [Booking Wizard](./booking-wizard.md) guide.

For both cases, it is necessary to select an online Zoom location during creation.

## Manual Booking from Dashboard

‚ùóÔ∏è This manual is for merchants and their staff who has access to Sakurabook Admin inside the Shopify Admin console. Customers cannot create bookings this way.

1. Go to the Sakurabook dashboard site.

   ![Alt text](../img/Screenshot%202022-08-31%20at%200.59.53.png?raw=true "Sakurabook Booking Dashboard")

2. Click on the calendar where you want to create a booking.

3. Fill in all the necessary details, and make sure that the Staff and Service Type is correct. Select the **Zoom** location to make the booking online.

5. Your customer will receive an invoice email from Shopify to complete the purchase. The customer then needs to pay for the order in several easy steps. This flow can be customized for several shops. Below are the usual steps.

   - Click on the `Complete your purchase` button in the email.
   - Fill in your details, then go to the next page.
   - Fill in the payment details, use [Bogus Gateway](https://help.shopify.com/en/manual/checkout-settings/test-orders) for test orders. Then pay for the order by clicking the `Pay now` button.
   - See the confirmation page.

6. After the booking is paid, your customer receives an order confirmation email from Shopify with information that the booking was successfully paid.

7. At the same time, there is one more email delivered directly from the Sakurabook app that confirms the reservation. This email also includes the **Zoom join url** for the customer in the location section.

8. The last step is to go back to the Sakurabook dashboard, open the detail of the recently created booking and check that both the `Zoom staff link` and `Zoom customer link` are present. The `Zoom staff link` is the online event start url, and the latter is the online event join url. Make sure that your staff has the `Zoom staff link` ready.

   üìå These links get updated whenever you change the booking details on the customer's behalf. Same for booking deletion.

9. There is actually one more detail. If you have also your [Google Calendar](./connect-google-calendar.md) connected, you can see the `Zoom customer link` also in the location of the Google calendar event.

## Booking Wizard

‚ùóÔ∏è This manual is mainly for customers.

1. Follow the steps for service reservation inside [Booking Wizard](./booking-wizard.md#service-reservation). Don't forget to select Zoom location to make the booking online.

2. After the booking is paid, your customer receives an order confirmation email from Shopify with information that the booking was successfully paid.

3. At the same time, there is one more email delivered directly from the Sakurabook app that confirms the reservation. This email also includes the **Zoom join url** for the customer in the location section.

   üìå The **Zoom join url** gets updated after each booking update. Then there is a Sakurabook booking updated email delivered to customers.
