📌 All the required fields are labeled with `*`.

## Calendar

This is a view-only calendar overview. It shows only bookings related to one particular Rental Space to which this detail is related. Currently, you cannot manage bookings from here. You need to go to Dashboard. It offers a day/week view.

## Assigned add-ons

Another element on this page is the Assigned Add-ons section. By clicking on the `Add Add-ons` button, you can connect Add-ons to the Rental space. These will be then available for booking together with the Rental space.
