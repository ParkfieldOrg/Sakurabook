## Products and Staff

Yes, we've already imported some products during onboarding, but what about new ones? If you want to know how to add more to your menu, have a look at the [Import Product]() guide.

Everything is imported and you are looking for a guide explaining how to set the business hours, length of the booking, or bio and contact details of your staff? Let's have a deep dive into [Create Rental Space]() and [Rental Space (De)Activation]() guides for everything around your rental space products. Furthermore, [Create Service]() and [Service (De)Activation]() are the right guides if you selected **Service reservation** use case. Last but not least, for this use case, you also need to know how to [Create Staff]() and how to handle [Staff (De)Activation]().

This is all you need to know about your Products (Rental spaces/Services) and Staff. You should be now ready to create your first bookings.

## Dashboard and Bookings

As you already know, the Sakurabook Dashboard serves as the main booking overview for merchants. It offers you a view over all your rental spaces or staff and services, you can use both day or week views. Also, you can [Manage Bookings]() on the dashboard by simply interacting with the calendar view.

ðŸ’¸ Are you not sure how the pricing algorithm works and want to be fully transparent with your customers? We prepared for you some pricing examples in the [Price for Bookings](./price-for-bookings.md) guide. It will help you understand how we are counting the prices.

## Settings and Integrations

Ok, we went through the Dashboard, Spaces, Services, and Staff sections of the menu. What's left? It's the settings of the Sakurabook app. This [Settings]() guide will help you understand all the items on the settings menu.

Moreover, settings also help you manage your Google Calendar and Zoom integrations. Zoom is particularly important when you offer online services with the **Service reservation** use case. Please follow the [Connect Google Calendar]() and [Connect Zoom]() guides to successfully connect to these platforms.

ðŸ’¡ **Troubleshooting**: Integrations are always tricky. We rely on a 3rd party in this matter and we cannot always guarantee that everything works as expected. Nevertheless, it should work correctly but if you run into an issue during connections, please get to [Support](https://sakurabook.app/pages/support) and we'll take care of it with priority.

## Billing

Last but not least, Sakurabook is a paid Shopify app and we want to be as transparent as possible also regarding subscriptions. Here is a detailed guide around [Billing Plans]().
