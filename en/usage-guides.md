# Usage Guides

In this text, you will find everything you need to use the Sakurabook app.

📌 Make sure you finished the [Setting Up the App in Shopify](setting-up-the-app-in-shopify.md) guide and got everything set. Without installing and setting up the app, this guide won't be really helpful for you.

💡 **Troubleshooting**: If anything goes wrong, get in touch with our [Support](https://sakurabook.app/pages/support), please. We are as available as possible and really keen to help.

## Products and Staff

Yes, we've already imported some products during onboarding, but what about new ones? If you want to know how to add more to your menu, have a look at the [Import Product](./import-product.md) guide.

Everything is imported and you are looking for a guide explaining how to set the pricing, business hours, length of the booking, or bio and contact details of your staff? Let's have a deep dive into [Create Rental Space](./create-rental-space.md) and [Rental Space De/Activation](rental-space-de-activation.md) guides for everything around your rental space products. Furthermore, [Create Service](./create-service.md) and [Service De/Activation](./service-de-activation.md) are the right guides if you selected **Service reservation** use case. Last but not least, for this use case, you also need to know how to [Create Staff](./create-staff.md) and how to handle [Staff De/Activation](./staff-de-activation.md).

This is all you need to know about your Products (Rental spaces/Services) and Staff. You should be now ready to create your first bookings.

## Dashboard and Bookings

As you already know, the Sakurabook Dashboard serves as the main booking overview for merchants. It offers you a view over all your rental spaces or staff and services, you can use both day or week views. Also, you can [Manage Bookings]() on the dashboard by simply interacting with the calendar view.

💸 Are you not sure how the pricing algorithm works and want to be fully transparent with your customers? We prepared for you some pricing examples in the [Price for Bookings](./price-for-bookings.md) guide. It will help you understand how we are counting the prices.

## Settings and Integrations

Ok, we went through the Dashboard, Spaces, Services, and Staff sections of the menu. What's left? It's the settings of the Sakurabook app. This [Settings]() guide will help you understand all the items on the settings menu.

Moreover, settings also help you manage your Google Calendar and Zoom integrations. Zoom is particularly important when you offer online services with the **Service reservation** use case. Please follow the [Connect Google Calendar]() and [Connect Zoom]() guides to successfully connect to these platforms.

💡 **Troubleshooting**: Integrations are always tricky. We rely on a 3rd party in this matter and we cannot always guarantee that everything works as expected. Nevertheless, it should work correctly but if you run into an issue during connections, please get to [Support](https://sakurabook.app/pages/support) and we'll take care of it with priority.

## Booking Wizard

We cannot forget about our customer-facing component which you already installed and added to your Shopify Theme as part of the [Setting up](./setting-up-the-app-in-shopify.md) guide. Here we are going to show you how it works for both use cases, or what Themes you can add it to and where. Check [Booking Wizard]() for more.

## Billing

Last but not least, Sakurabook is a paid Shopify app and we want to be as transparent as possible also regarding subscriptions. Here is a detailed guide around [Billing Plans](./billing-plans.md).
