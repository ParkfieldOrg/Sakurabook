# Create Service

After you import the new Service, go to the service detail page. In this guide, we'll focus on describing all fields that need to be filled before the service is available.

## Calendar

This is a view-only calendar overview. It shows only bookings related to one particular Service to which this detail is related. Currently, you cannot manage bookings from here. You need to go to Dashboard. It offers a day/week view.

## Assigned add-ons

Another element on this page is the Assigned Add-ons section. By clicking on the `Add Add-ons` button, you can connect Add-ons to the Service. These will be then available for booking together with the Service.

## Assigned staff

Each service needs to be assigned to staff to be available for reservations. Click on the `Add staff` button and select staff who are offering this service. Customers can then select which staff they want to book for a particular service in your store.

Fill in the location of your service. However, this is a view-only section. You can change to a location on staff detail. Click on the staff thumbnail that will navigate you there.
