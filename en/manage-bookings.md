# Manage Bookings

Sakurabook Dashboard allows you to create, edit and delete all your bookings. It's supposed to be the main control board for every merchant.

ðŸ“Œ This dashboard will show all the bookings within your store. It will show not only the bookings you create manually, there are going to be all bookings created by the administrator and by the customers directly via your Shopify store.

## Create Booking

1. Click on the calendar where you want to create a booking.

   ðŸ“Œ Each row in the day view is corresponding to one rental space or staff. On the other hand, in the week view, you need to select Staff and Service Type wisely.

2. Fill in all the necessary details, and make sure that the Staff and Service Type is correct.

   ðŸ“Œ Be aware that you cannot create bookings outside of the booking hours, in the gray area respectively. Moreover, you cannot create bookings in the past and for staff or spaces which are inactive.

## Edit or Delete Booking

If you want to change booking time or delete a particular booking, go back to the Dashboard section and click on the booking that you want to edit or delete. Make the changes and press the `Save` button. Or press the `Delete` button for cancelling the booking manually.

## Manually Created Bookings

After you create a booking on your dashboard, your customer will receive an invoice to be paid from Shopify. After the payment proceeds, Sakurabook will send the customer a **confirmation email** about the booking and the reservation is considered as paid.

**TODO:** Screenshot of the notification email should be updated once we have the new design.

## Cancellation Handling

When your customers want to cancel their bookings, they need to communicate it with you as a merchant and you need to manage their bookings in the dashboard manually. We currently do not offer a customer-facing interface for booking cancellations.

ðŸ’¡ We are preparing automatic cancellations for future versions of the Sakurabook app.
