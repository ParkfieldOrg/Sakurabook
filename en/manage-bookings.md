   📌 Each row in the day view is corresponding to one rental space or staff. On the other hand, in the week view, you need to select Staff and Service Type wisely.

2. Fill in all the necessary details, and make sure that the Staff and Service Type is correct.

   📌 Be aware that you cannot create bookings outside of the booking hours, in the gray area respectively. Moreover, you cannot create bookings in the past and for staff or spaces which are inactive.

## Manually Created Bookings

After you create a booking on your dashboard, your customer will receive an invoice to be paid from Shopify. After the payment proceeds, Sakurabook will send the customer a **confirmation email** about the booking and the reservation is considered as paid.

**TODO:** Screenshot of the notification email should be updated once we have the new design.
